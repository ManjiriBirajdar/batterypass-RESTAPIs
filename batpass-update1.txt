The consortium project Battery Pass aims to develop cross-industry content and technical standards for a digital battery passport and demonstrate them in a pilot project. The battery passport supports seamless documentation of the battery life from production and use to reuse and recycling. This is intended to enable the sustainable and circular management of traction batteries. Basic battery information as well as technical data are stored in the battery passport. In particular, data that comprehensively describe the sustainability and responsibility of the supply chain, such as greenhouse gas footprint, working conditions in raw material extraction, determination of battery condition (age/quality), recyclability and repair are to be documented in the battery passport and help to implement these steps. The data of the battery passport can be accessed and updated via corresponding infrastructures.
